This guide provides a straightforward approach to creating a new MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL database in Virtualmin. 

### How to create a new database

Creating a database is a common requirement for website development and application management. Virtualmin provides an easy way to set up a new MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL database. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Select the domain**  
   After logging into Virtualmin, choose the domain for which you want to create the database. Do this by selecting the domain name from the drop-down box in the top-left corner of the left menu.

2. **Navigate to database management**  
   Click on **Edit Databases**, which is where you manage all database-related settings for your domain.

3. **Create a new database**  
   Click on **Create a new database**. This will open a form to set up your new database:

4. **Configure database settings**  
   - **Database name**: Choose a name for your database and enter it in the **Database name** field. This name should be unique and descriptive.
   - **Database server type**: In the **Database server type** field, select either MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL. If you're unsure which to choose, MySQL/MariaDB is a popular choice for its ease of use and broad compatibility.

5. **Create the database**  
   Click **Create**. Virtualmin will process your input and establish the new database.

Once successfully created, this new database will be associated with your selected virtual server.
