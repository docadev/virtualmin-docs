This guide simplifies the process of viewing website access and error logs in Virtualmin.

### How to view website access and error logs

Monitoring your website's access and error logs is crucial for understanding traffic patterns and identifying potential issues. Virtualmin makes this process straightforward. Here's how to do it:

1. **Select the domain**: Log into Virtualmin and choose the domain whose logs you want to view. Select the domain name from the drop-down box in the top-left corner of the left menu.

2. **Navigate to logs and reports**: Click on **Logs and Reports**. This section is dedicated to various logs and reports related to your domain's performance and activities.

3. **Access Apache access log**: To view the access log, which contains records of all requests made to your website (like page or image requests), click on **Apache Access Log**. This log is helpful for understanding your website's traffic and user behavior.

4. **Access Apache error log**: For the error log, which records errors encountered by the server (such as file not found errors or script issues), click on **Apache Error Log**. Reviewing this log is essential for troubleshooting and resolving issues on your website.

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor both the access and error logs for your website in Virtualmin, helping you stay informed about its performance and quickly address any problems.
