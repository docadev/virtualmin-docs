### Lists shared IP addresses for virtual servers

This command outputs a list of shared IP addresses that can be used by new or existing virtual servers.

Output is in table format by default, but you can switch to a more detailed and easily parsed list with the `--multiline` flag. Or to just get a list of addresses, use the `--name-only` parameter.

### Command line help

```text
virtualmin list-shared-addresses [--multiline | --name-only]

```
