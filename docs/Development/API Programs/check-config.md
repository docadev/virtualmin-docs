### Run the Virtualmin config check

This program checks your system's Virtualmin configuration, outputting the progress of the check as it goes. If any serious problems are found it will halt and display the error found.

Otherwise, it may also update global settings determined by the Virtualmin configuration, such as Webmin modules granted to domain owners.

### Command line help

```text
virtualmin check-config
```
