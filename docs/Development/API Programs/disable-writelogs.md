### Disable logging via program

This command is the opposite `enable-writelogs`. The domains that it operates on are specified either using the `--domain` flag (which can appear multiple times), or `--all-domains` to turn off logging via script for all of them.

### Command line help

```text
virtualmin disable-writelogs --domain name | --all-domains
```
