### Lists API scripts available

This command lists all API commands available, categorized by type and with a brief summary of each. It is used to produce the output from the Virtualmin `--help` command. By default the output is in a human-readable format, but you can switch to a more parsable format with the `--multiline` flag.

### Command line help

```text
virtualmin list-commands [--short]
                         [--multiline | --name-only]
```
